File System vs DBMS

A File System stores data in separate files without centralized control, whereas a Database Management System (DBMS) provides an integrated, controlled, and systematic way of storing and managing data. The limitations of the file system led to the development of DBMS. The major problems of the file system and how DBMS overcomes them are explained below.


---

1. Data Redundancy and Inconsistency

File System

Same data is stored in multiple files.

Leads to duplication of data.

When data is updated in one file and not in others, inconsistency occurs.


Example

In a college:

Student details stored in:

Admission file

Exam file

Library file



If a student changes phone number and it is updated only in the exam file, other files still contain old data → inconsistency.

DBMS Solution

Data stored in a single centralized database.

Redundancy is minimized using normalization.

Any update reflects everywhere automatically.



---

2. Difficulty in Accessing the Data

File System

No standard query language.

New programs must be written for each new data request.

Complex data retrieval is time-consuming.


Example

To find:

> “All students with marks above 80 in DBMS and belonging to CSE department”



In a file system, a new program must be written manually.

DBMS Solution

Uses SQL (Structured Query Language).


SELECT name FROM student 
WHERE dept='CSE' AND marks > 80;

Easy, fast, and flexible data access.



---

3. Data Isolation

File System

Data scattered across multiple files and formats.

Difficult to combine data from different files.


Example

Employee data stored as:

Personal details → text file

Salary → Excel file

Attendance → binary file


Combining these files is complex.

DBMS Solution

Data stored in tables with relationships.

Easy to retrieve combined data using JOIN operations.



---

4. Integrity Problems

File System

Integrity constraints are hard-coded in programs.

No automatic enforcement of rules.


Example

Age should be > 18

Marks should be between 0 and 100


Programmers must manually check these conditions in every program.

DBMS Solution

Supports integrity constraints:

NOT NULL

UNIQUE

CHECK

FOREIGN KEY



age INT CHECK (age >= 18);

Ensures accurate and valid data.


---

5. Atomicity Problems

File System

No support for transactions.

Partial updates may occur if system crashes.


Example

Bank transfer:

₹500 deducted from Account A

System crashes before adding to Account B


Result: Money lost

DBMS Solution

Supports transactions with atomicity.

Either all operations succeed or none.


BEGIN;
UPDATE account SET balance=balance-500 WHERE acc_no=101;
UPDATE account SET balance=balance+500 WHERE acc_no=102;
COMMIT;


---

6. Concurrent-Access Anomalies

File System

Multiple users accessing same data cause problems.

No concurrency control.


Example

Two users withdraw money simultaneously from the same account:

Both read balance = ₹1000

Both withdraw ₹600
Final balance becomes incorrect.


DBMS Solution

Provides concurrency control using:

Locks

Transactions

Isolation levels



Ensures data consistency even with multiple users.


---

7. Security Problems

File System

Limited security options.

File-level security only.

No fine-grained access control.


Example

Anyone with file access can view or modify sensitive salary data.

DBMS Solution

Strong security features:

User authentication

Authorization

Roles and privileges



GRANT SELECT ON student TO faculty;

Only authorized users can access data.
